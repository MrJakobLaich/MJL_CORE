okay, so
I want iron ore on the map
I want coal on the map
Iron ore should be smelted with coal into iron bars

tier flowchart
none -> stone -> iron -> steel

you get "wood" from trees
"wood" is processed into "wood parts"
you get "stone chunks" from a stone mine, which costs "wood" and "wood parts"
"wood parts" and "stone chunks" produce "stone tools" (for now, later this should be split into different tools)

"stone tools" should be unlocked from the start
further tool stuff should unlock via research

iron mine needs to be unlocked via research
"stone tools" with "wood" and "wood parts" let you make an iron mine
coal mine needs to be unlocked via research
"stone tools" with "wood" and "wood parts" let you make a coal mine

"iron chunks" are mined from an iron mine
"coal chunks" are mined from a coal mine

smeltery is made with "stone chunks", "wood parts" and "wood"
"iron chunks" with "coal chunks" are processed in a smeltery, which returns "iron bars"

blacksmiths workshop is made with "stone tools, "stone chunks", "wood parts" and "wood"
"iron bars" together with "wood parts" and "coal chunks" are used in a blacksmiths workshop to make "iron tools"
